## Prerequisites

Ensure you are using Python 3.9 and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data set preparation

Due to the storage space limitations of GitHub, some data sets may need to be downloaded separately. However, some small data sets have been included in the repository for demonstration purposes. If you encounter any issues with the data sets, please contact us via email.

If you have any questions, please contact <liwei008009@163.com> or submit an issue. 
Due to time constraints, business agreements and intellectual property protection, the implementation of this model is partial. If you are interested in our model, please contact me by email. 
This repo model is a simplified model and is allowed for commercial use, but please cite. If you want to use the complete implementation model, you can further negotiate business cooperation, thank you very much for your attention.
